* Key differences between static and Non-static
1. Scope: static-members are class-levels, while non-static members are instance levels. 
2. Access: static members are accessed using the class name, while non-static members are access using an instance of class.
3. Use Cases: static is used for data or methods that are common to all instances, and non-static is used for data or methods that vary between instances.
4. Memory: static members share memory across all instance where as non-static members have their own memory per instance.
